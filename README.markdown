## Description:

Roulette is a popular casino game in which gamblers place bets wagering on which number the roulette wheel will land on. In the classic game, gamblers may place bets on various attributes of the possible number, like color, range, odd or even, etc. In this simplified version, we are boiling it all down to chance - can you guess the random number the wheel will land on? Or how many tries will it take to land on your lucky number?

All you have to do is plug in your lucky number and give it a whirl. Don't worry if you don't get it the first time - you can always press reset and try again!

## Next Steps

  - Add a version of a roulette betting board, where a player would be able to place bets manually by clicking and placing chips on a basic board such as this:

  - Include an area for score keeping and give the player a limited number of rounds, perhaps even tracking the highest score for the game.

  - At an even higher level, include the entire functionality of the classic casino Roulette game, allowing for different types of bets rather than just on each individual number, and different sized bets based on these bet categories. At this level, it would also be visually interesting to include a ball moving on the roulette wheel and falling on a specific segment, rather than using the current pointer to select thee winning number.
