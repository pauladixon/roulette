## Background

The origins of the game known as ‘roulette’ are shrouded in mystery. The most widely accepted version is that the first incarnation of the game was created by French math wizard and accomplished nerd Blaise Pascal somewhere in the 17th century, while he was hard at work trying to create a perpetual motion machine (roulettesites.org).

Roulette is a popular casino game in which gamblers place bets wagering on which number the roulette wheel will land on. In the classic game, gamblers may place bets on various attributes of the possible number, like color, range, odd or even, etc. In this simplified version, we are boiling it all down to chance - can you guess the random number the wheel will land on? Or how many tries will it take to land on your lucky number? Give it a spin!

## Technologies

## Next Steps

  In future iterations, I imagine adding the a version of a roulette betting board, where a player would be able to place bets manually by clicking and placing chips on a basic board such as this:

  In this iteration a player might have 3 chips and be able to place them either on 3 different numbers or all on the same number for a higher score. This version would also include an area for score keeping and give the player a limited number of rounds, perhaps even tracking the highest score for the game.

  At an even higher level, this could be built out from here to include the entire functionality of the classic casino Roulette game, allowing for different types of bets rather than just on each individual number, and different sized bets based on these bet categories. At this level, it would also be visually interesting to include a ball moving on the roulette wheel and falling on a specific segment, rather than using the current pointer to select thee winning number.

  Stay tuned for these updates and thanks for checking out my game!
